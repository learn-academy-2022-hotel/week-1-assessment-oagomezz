# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer: a conditional is a statement that is created in order to create logic within a program, it can help define the parameters required to be true to continue with the next piece of code and return the desired output. 

Researched answer: A conditional statement tells a program to display the appropriate output depending on whether the condition was met or not. It often uses if/ else statements .

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer:Git is a version control software utilized by Github and the difference from github is that while git is used for version control, github is used to hold and access repos on the remote via your local node.

Researched answer:Git is a tool used as a revision control system that can be used to track changes or updates to a program. It helps mitigate obsolete revisions and assists program developers to backtrack if the code starts to get buggy. Github is a cloud based repository that helps developers store and manage their progams along with any changes that were made. 

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value? 

Your answer: logical operators since the conditions are based off booleans, with each respective answer will return a different output. 

Researched answer: the logical operators that will return a boolean value will be the && operator or logical and which requires both operands to be true to evaluate the condition as true. The || operator requires one of the operands to be true in order to evaluate the condition as true the final logical operator is the bang (!) which returns the opposite of the value for example value != 0 returns for any value not equal to 0. 

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: An index is the position held by the specified value on a string or array, whereas the value pertains to the data type value within the string or array. Ex. [1,2,3] "1" would have a value of 1 but an index of 0. "3" would have a value of 3 but an index of 2.  

Researched answer: an index represents a read only position of an element in a string or an array whereas a value represents the datatype of the input. In an array the index is always going to be one lower than the value of the array because the index is zero based.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both strings and arrays are used to hold collections of things for example strings are a collection of characters ("Hello Hotel 2022") while arrays are a collection of data types [1,true,null,undefined]. The things that they hold are a key difference between the two along with some of the built in methods utilized to mutate (mutators) or access (accessors) them. 

Researched answer: Arrays can hold multiple values whereas other data types can only hold a single value such as strings. Arrays have a zero based index meaning that the first index in the array is going to be zero regardless of the value being input. unlike strings, Arrays can be manipulated to be seperated or combined with other arrays along with a variety of other built in methods such as reversing an array or sorting it by alphabetical order. strings and arrays are similar in the way they are declared they both have to be assigned to a variable in order to be invoked. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: The two roles for for pair programming are driver and navigator. the driver is the one with hands on the keyboard actually working on the code. the navigator has a roadmap or "plan" for the code and is loosely pseudocoding for the driver. It is the drivers role to verify code is being typed accurately and let's it be known when mistakes arise. 

Researched answer: Proper pair programming techniques require a lot of patience as pair programming is not an easy feat. Micro-management must be avoided in order to create a healthy work environment. roles should be switched consistently so both people receive ample experience having hands on the keyboard and typing while also developing great communication techniques. 

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: functions that can be assigned to variables and return an output of another function or accepts a function as a parameter for the function. It is used to simplify the code and indicates more abstraction which means hiding all data relating to an object to increase efficiency. 

2. Jest: Javascript testing framework designed to ensure javascript is correct. Allows you to run tests.

3. Objects: objects are variables being utilized in code. an object can contain many values. For example, const cat = {firstName: "bailey, color: "black and gray", eyeColor: "green", age: 5} all characteristics that pertain to the object which would be my cat bailey.

4. Method: a function that can be applied to the object. Some common examples used are the sort() and join () built in methods. 

5. Classes: like functions can be defined by specified variable names. Different parameters can be set in order to classify your input data.
